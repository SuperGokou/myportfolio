# 🤵 Alfred - AI Holographic Portfolio

> *"Master Hanlin, Alfred is at your service."*

Alfred is an immersive, voice-activated 3D portfolio assistant. Unlike static websites, Alfred uses a **local Large Language Model (Llama 3)** to hold natural conversations, answer questions about my skills, and project holographic data cards in real-time.

        ```bash
        launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
        ```
3.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```

### 2. Install & Run the Frontend
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/alfred-portfolio.git](https://github.com/yourusername/alfred-portfolio.git)
    cd alfred-portfolio
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash

    ```

## 🎮 How to Interact
